## Abstract
In Norway, where homeownership is deeply ingrained with nearly four out of five households owning their property, understanding the future trajectory of the housing market is paramount. This study specifically focuses on the row house market in Oslo, using data from 1992-2023. Through a comparative analysis between the ETS and ARIMA forecasting models against a simple drift model, the study seeks to determine the most effective predictive tool. Results indicate that while the ARIMA model outperforms the ETS, surprisingly, both are surpassed in accuracy by the simple drift model. However, the drift model's linear approach might overlook the market's natural oscillations, making ARIMA a more nuanced predictor. This insight is of importance for various stakeholders, from homeowners to policymakers. Potential areas for further research include refining forecast models and a deeper dive into specific housing market sectors.
