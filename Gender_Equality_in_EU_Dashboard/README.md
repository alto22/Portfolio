## Abstract
The European Union’s Gender Equality Strategy (2020-2025) ambitiously endeavors to promote equality between genders across various dimensions. A dashboard was developed to measure progress in seven of the eight key objectives outlined by the Strategy. This tool is particularly useful for tracking EU-wide progress and offers country-specific insights. Two primary audiences can benefit from this dashboard: the European Commission members formulating the gender equality strategy, and the policymakers in EU states implementing these plans. The data sourced for this dashboard provides a comprehensive reflection of the objectives, including aspects not covered by the European Institute for Gender Equality’s index. The study emphasizes the dashboard’s utility in offering insights for strategy refinement, benchmarking gender equality progress, and encouraging policy collaboration across states. Challenges encountered during its development include data inconsistencies across countries and the complexity of capturing multi-faceted objectives. Future work could delve into more granular data analysis for enriched insights.
